# CGI-Threes

CGI-Threes is an AI program for Game Threes!, developed by CGI-Lab (http://www.aigames.nctu.edu.tw/)<br/>
Chia-Chuan Chang, Chao-Chin Liang in 2014~2015

CGI-Threes won the first place in the Threes group of Taiwan 2048 Bot Tournament in 2014. To the best of our knowledge (in August 2014), our program outperforms all the known Threes AI program.

Our algorithm is based on the following two papers:

[1] Szubert, M. amd Jaskowaski, W., “Temporal Difference Learning of N-tuple Networks for the Game 2048”, IEEE CIG 2014 conference, August 2014.

[2] I-Chen Wu, Kun-Hao Yeh, Chao-Chin Liang, Chia-Chuan Chang, and Han Chiang, "Multi-Stage Temporal Difference Learning for 2048", the 2014 Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI 2014), Taipei, Taiwan, Novemeber 2014.
